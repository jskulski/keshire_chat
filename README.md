To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`

## Principles

- Define the problem, then find a tool that fits it. If it doesn't exist, build it.
- Keep development painless, remove hurdles, tighten feedback loops
- Communicate early, release often, integrate frequently
- Solve for the general case after you solve the specific case
- 99% Work, 1% Metawork. Stay focused and improve every. single. day.
